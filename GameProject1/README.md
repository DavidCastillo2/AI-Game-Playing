This folder has the files that you will need for Project One. 

You should create your AI player in a new (separate package). 
Do NOT add your files to ProjectOneEngine. 
Instead, you should import the files you need from ProjectOneEngine (e.g. the Player Interface)

Your AI players should implement the ProjectOneEngine.Player interface. 

Note: To start a game, I recommend that you compile all the files.
Then once you have compiled the files, use Java to run ProjectOneEngine.AIGameApp or ProjectOneEngine.HumanGameApp

I have my Javafx files in C:\javafx
Therefore, I use the following command to start a game (from the command line):
 
java --module-path  C:\javafx\lib --add-modules javafx.controls ProjectOneEngine.HumanGameApp
